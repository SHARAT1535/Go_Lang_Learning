#G0_LANG 
Day 1
On Day 1 of learning Go, I focused on setting up the Go development environment and understanding the basics of the language. I installed Go, verified the setup, and wrote my first Go program. I learned how to declare and use variables, print output using the fmt package, and take user input from the terminal. This day helped me build a strong foundation for writing and running simple Go programs.

On Day 2, I focused on essential Go programming concepts such as functions, error handling, arrays, and slicing. I learned about function syntax, parameters, and multiple return values, emphasizing reusable and structured code for maintainability. Additionally, I studied error handling techniques, including explicit return of errors and their impact on program reliability. I explored arrays and slices, understanding their definitions, initializations, and element access, along with the flexibility provided by slicing for efficient data manipulation. This day reinforced my Go fundamentals, enhancing my capability to write efficient and robust programs.
