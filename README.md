# G0_LANG 
# Day 1
On Day 1 of learning Go, I focused on setting up the Go development environment and understanding the basics of the language. I installed Go, verified the setup, and wrote my first Go program. I learned how to declare and use variables, print output using the fmt package, and take user input from the terminal. This day helped me build a strong foundation for writing and running simple Go programs.

# Day 2
I focused on essential Go programming concepts such as functions, error handling, arrays, and slicing. I learned about function syntax, parameters, and multiple return values, emphasizing reusable and structured code for maintainability. Additionally, I studied error handling techniques, including explicit return of errors and their impact on program reliability. I explored arrays and slices, understanding their definitions, initializations, and element access, along with the flexibility provided by slicing for efficient data manipulation. This day reinforced my Go fundamentals, enhancing my capability to write efficient and robust programs.

#Day 3
On Day 3 of my Go learning journey, I focused on understanding control flow statements and maps in Go. I learned how to use if-else and switch statements to implement decision-making logic and practised writing small programs based on different conditions. I also explored maps, including how to declare, access, update, and delete key-value pairs. Along with learning these concepts, I partially completed the assignment given to me by applying if-else, switch, and maps in my code, which helped me strengthen my practical understanding of Go.
