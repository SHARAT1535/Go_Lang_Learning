#G0_LANG 
Day 1
On Day 1 of learning Go, I focused on setting up the Go development environment and understanding the basics of the language. I installed Go, verified the setup, and wrote my first Go program. I learned how to declare and use variables, print output using the fmt package, and take user input from the terminal. This day helped me build a strong foundation for writing and running simple Go programs.
